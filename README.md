# Power Cut Auto Delay Circuit âš¡ðŸ”Œ

## Overview
This project is a protective electronic circuit that delays the reconnection of appliances (e.g., fridge, oven) after power restoration, preventing damage from sudden voltage surges.

## Features
- AC protection & filtering using AL Capacitor and Varistor
- Bridge Rectifier (KBP210) + 470ÂµF Filter Capacitor
- Zener Diode-based 12V Regulation
- Adjustable Delay Circuit using 1000ÂµF Capacitor
- Relay Control Circuit with IRFZ44N MOSFET
- LED Indicators for system status
- Fully implemented on PCB and simulated on Proteus

## Tools & Components
- Proteus (simulation)
- Soldering & PCB design
- GitHub repository (code + simulation files)
